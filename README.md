## Documentation

For detailed guidelines on creating new levels, refer to the [Level Creation Rubric](docs/level-creation.md).

For detailed guidelines on creating new heroes, refer to the [Hero Manifestation Guide](docs/hero-manifestation-guide.md).

The Level Creation Rubric provides comprehensive guidelines for defining level properties such as `level`, `title`, `rows`, `cols`, `wallHP`, and `enemies`. It also explains the use of the `enemyGenerator` function for dynamic enemy generation and offers examples and best practices for creating balanced and engaging levels.

The Hero Manifestation Guide now includes new hero stats `yeet` and `swarm`, which are used by the new heroes "Yeetrian" and "Mellitron" respectively. These stats add new dimensions to hero abilities and strategies in the game.

The Level Creation Rubric has been updated to include guidelines for creating multi-level layouts with stairs or ladders, allowing for more complex and engaging level designs.
